Java has the "Qubit Log" which is a JSON document that maps qubits to circuits

{
    "qubit_index" : circuit_index,
    "314" : 159,
    "265" : 358
}

The Qubit Log gets modified in the following ways:
- new entries are added when a qubit item is created
- entries are deleted when qubit items are destroyed (optional)
- the associated circuit may change when qubits are entangled
- the associated circuit will change when the circuit is measured

Qubit and Circuit indices may be either sequential or random, as long as the chance of an accidental collision is negligible


Java also keeps the Circuit Log, which maps circuits to a collection of information about that circuit:

{
    "circuit_index" : {
                          "qubits" : [first_qubit_index, second_qubit_index,...],
                          "measure_blocks" : {
                                                 "first_qubit_index" : measure_block_location_XYZ 
                                             }
                          "circuit" : [
                                          {
                                              "gate_name" : gate_name, (examples: "X", "CNOT", "XX", "RX" etc.)
                                              "qubit_indices" : [first_qubit_index, ...],
                                              "gate_parameter" : gate_parameter (this is ignored for gates like CNOT)
                                          }
                                      ]
                      },

                                              "gate_parameter" : 15/16 // let python multiply by pi

                                          {

                                              "gate_parameter" : 0 // this value is ignoredS
                                          },
